# Hi, I'm Rolf Streefkerk 👋

## Solution Architect | Software Entrepreneur | Technical Writer

With over 20 years in IT, I've built a career focused on solving technical problems and creating practical solutions for businesses. I've worked hands-on in development, consulted for large companies, and started my own tech ventures.

### Key Highlights:

• Delivered custom IT solutions for Airbus Group, improving processes under tight deadlines
• Co-founded Eezze.io, a low-code platform that speeds up backend development and system integration
• Designed cloud solutions on AWS to improve scalability and reduce costs
• Developed software using technologies like SAP, Java, Typescript, and React

I specialize in identifying and solving technical challenges quickly, and I enjoy explaining complex IT topics in a simple, understandable way. My focus is on providing solutions that make a real difference for businesses.

### Right now, I'm working on:

1. Sharing IT insights and practical tips on RolfStreefkerk.com
2. Automating Social Media / SEO optimized content creation through InsightProse.com

Whether it's cloud architecture, software development, or helping businesses adopt new technologies, I bring practical solutions that work.
