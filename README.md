# Hi, I'm Rolf Streefkerk 👋

### I create IT solutions and educational content in the fields of; Health, Science, and IT.

With 20+ years of experience in the IT field. I've developed expert technical writing skills, and a curious nature that allows me to understand complex topics at a fundamental level.

As a Consultant and Entrepreneur for a combined 10+ years, I've delivered custom solutions for large clients such as Airbus Group. I’ve built 4 software products,  and migrated one to the AWS Cloud.

In the last 3 years, I have co-founded <a href="https://eezze.io" target="_blank">Eezze</a>. We help clients with automation. Solving; manual process inefficiencies, access to legacy systems, and creating efficient workflows.

As a consultant and entrepreneur. I help clients automate their processes, and navigate complex topics in the fields of health and science.
